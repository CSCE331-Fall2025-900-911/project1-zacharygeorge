<!-- AI-generated page
Uses Generative AI to create one additional page.
Not required to change styles like the other required pages.
note: styling will be handled through AI-generated inline CSS instead of from the required external CSS files 
Presents the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (genAI).
Starts with a simple prompt.
Continually adds to the prompt until output is satisfied by you.
Creates a text box in the new page (Generative AI services can do this for you) that contains the prompt used by you in the final version of your AI-generated page.
Label the page as genai.html. -->
