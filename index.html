        <h1>Zachary George</h1>
        <p>Computer Science @ Texas A&M | Mentorship & Service</p>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Zachary George, a Texas A&M University computer science student who enjoys
            building practical software and computer-vision prototypes. I care about
            clear communication, shipping reliable code, and contributing to teams that serve
            real people. On this site you'll find selected projects, my resume and technical skills,
            and ways I give back through mentorship.
        </p>
