<h2>Mentoring Young Men</h2>
<p>
I serve with a mentorship organization that supports young men (ages 5-17) from
underserved areas of Bryan and College Station. We focus on consistency, encouragement, and practical skills.
I help with homework check-ins, organizing activities, and sharing basic tech literacy,
anything from setting up a first email account to brainstorming small projects that build
confidence. For me, the goal is to show up reliably and listen first. The most rewarding
moments are when a student takes ownership of an idea and runs with it.

<h2>Music & Community</h2>
<p>
I'm part of a worship team, which has taught me collaboration, preparation, and how to stay
calm under time pressure. Musically, I enjoy connecting technical gear knowledge with people-first
problem solving—setting up signal chains, solving routing issues, and making sure the tech supports
the purpose of the event rather than getting in the way.
