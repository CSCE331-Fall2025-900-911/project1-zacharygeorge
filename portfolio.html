<!-- Technical portfolio
Describes technical projects you have completed or would like to complete.
Provides interesting details for the audience which may include links to your TAMU GitHub repository for these projects, thumbnails, and descriptions.

3–4 project “cards” with: a 1–2 sentence problem statement, 1–2 sentence approach, and stack.

Link each to a repo or write-up (placeholders are in the draft; swap with your real links).

Examples I prefilled for you:

Depth Estimation Sandbox (geometry → toy model → pretrained MiDaS comparison)

Algorithms & Data Structures Notes (C++/Python, trade-offs)

Database Systems Mini-Labs (SQL, normalization, ERD)

Music/DSP Experiments (routing, latency notes) -->

<h2>Depth Estimation Sandbox</h2>
<p>
A learning-oriented sandbox that walks from geometric camera models to using
pretrained depth-estimation networks. Includes a small toy model for intuition and a MiDaS-based exploration.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Python, NumPy, PyTorch basics, image preprocessing</li>
</ul>




<h2>Neural Volume Rendering Research (Aggie Research Program)</h2>
<p><strong>College Station, TX - Aug 2024-Present</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a computer-vision pipeline that transforms 2D images into detailed 3D reconstructions using Zip-NeRF and CamP.</li>
<li>Implemented image processing techniques—feature detection, matching, and stereo cues—to align multi-view images into a consistent 3D space.</li>
<li>Collected scene-level image data over time and explored object-oriented algorithms and novel view synthesis to enhance neural radiance fields.</li>
</ul>
