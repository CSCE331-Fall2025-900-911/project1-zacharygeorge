            <h2>Skills & Technical Interests</h2>
            <p>
            I enjoy the combination of strong fundamentals and practical projects. On the fundamentals side,
            I'm building depth with data structures and algorithms (graphs, shortest paths, dynamic programming),
            systems topics (memory, pointers, and performance characteristics in C++), and database concepts
            (relational modeling, normalization, and SQL query planning). I document what I learn, and I value
            code that's readable, testable, and measured. When I don't know something, I'm comfortable starting
            with a small experiment, writing down assumptions, and iterating based on evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
            On the applied side, I'm exploring computer vision. Recent work includes a depth-estimation
            sandbox that starts with pinhole-camera math and simple transforms, then adds a toy neural model to build
            intuition, and finally compares outputs from a pretrained network. These experiments push me to think about
            data quality, preprocessing, and evaluation, not just model selection. I also like to connect projects to
            real-world needs; for instance, I'm interested in EMS or field scenarios where phone-based CV could help
            with triage or scene awareness. That context forces trade-offs around latency, robustness, and usability.
            </p>
            <p>
            Day-to-day, I work in C++ and Python. I like writing clear interfaces, using Git for disciplined version
            control, and organizing repos so teammates can contribute quickly. I'm comfortable learning from docs and
            official tutorials, then validating with small prototypes. I'm also committed to service and mentorship,
            which translates to a collaborative style in technical settings—asking good questions, offering help, and
            giving clear feedback. Over time I'd like to grow deeper in systems, database internals, and applied CV,
            with an eye toward building reliable software that actually helps people.

<!-- Qualifications section
Provides your resume in an easily accessible format (PDF preferred but HTML acceptable).
Embedded as a file hosted on Google Drive (if using the PDF file option).
Describes your technical skills in addition listing them on your resume.
Discusses your technical areas of interest in Computer Science and why.
Label the page as qualifications.html. -->

<!-- qualifications.html (Résumé + skills/interests)

PDF résumé embed from Google Drive (replace the file ID).
If you prefer, you can paste an HTML résumé instead.

A section with 300+ words (already drafted) describing your skills, interests, and how you work.

Links to docs/tools you actually use (Drive, Overleaf, Python docs, ISO C++). -->
